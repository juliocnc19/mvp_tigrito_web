# Navigation Routing - Fix Report

**Date**: 2025-01-17  
**Issue**: Routing error with dynamic service details page  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Description

When running `npm run dev`, the following error occurred:

```
[Error: Requested and resolved page mismatch: /(authenticated)/services//[id/]/page /(authenticated)/services/[id/]/page]
```

This indicated that:
1. Next.js found a conflicting route configuration
2. The dynamic parameter folder was created with an invalid name: `]/` instead of `[id]`
3. The path was being parsed incorrectly

---

## Root Cause

During the initial file creation, the folder for the dynamic route segment was created with an incorrect name:

```
INCORRECT: src/app/(authenticated)/services/]/page.tsx
CORRECT:   src/app/(authenticated)/services/[id]/page.tsx
```

This happened because of how the folder name was passed to the mkdir command. The `[id]` brackets were not properly escaped or handled.

---

## Solution Applied

### Step 1: Created Correct File
✅ Created the correct file at: `src/app/(authenticated)/services/[id]/page.tsx`

This file contains the complete Service Details page component with:
- Dynamic ID parameter handling
- Service mock data
- Negotiation panel
- Professional recommendations
- Location display
- All interactive features

### Step 2: Cleanup Required

The incorrect folder `]/` must be removed. Use this command:

```bash
cd /home/julio/workspace/mvp_tigrito_web
rm -rf "src/app/(authenticated)/services/]/"
```

**Or more robustly:**

```bash
cd /home/julio/workspace/mvp_tigrito_web && find src/app -type d -name "]" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
```

## File Structure - BEFORE

```
src/app/(authenticated)/services/
├── page.tsx                  ✓ Services list page
└── ]/                        ✗ INCORRECT FOLDER NAME
    └── page.tsx             (Old/Incorrect)
```

## File Structure - AFTER

```
src/app/(authenticated)/services/
├── page.tsx                  ✓ Services list page
└── [id]/                     ✓ CORRECT FOLDER NAME
    └── page.tsx             ✓ Service details page
```

### Component Features

## Verification Steps

After cleaning up the incorrect folder, verify the fix:

### 1. Remove Incorrect Folder
```bash
cd /home/julio/workspace/mvp_tigrito_web && rm -rf "src/app/(authenticated)/services/]/"
```

### 2. Check File Structure
```bash
ls -la src/app/\(authenticated\)/services/
```

Expected output:
```
drwxr-xr-x  pages/
-rw-r--r--  page.tsx (services list)
drwxr-xr-x  [id]/
```

### 3. Restart Dev Server
```bash
cd /home/julio/workspace/mvp_tigrito_web && npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Ready in XXXms
✓ Compiled successfully
```

### 4. Test Navigation
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/services/1`

Should display the Service Details page without errors.

## Technical Details

### Next.js Dynamic Routes (App Router)

In Next.js 15+ with App Router, dynamic routes are defined using folder names in square brackets:

```
/app/pages/[id]/page.tsx      → Route: /pages/123
/app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx    → Route: /posts/hello-world
```

The parameter name in brackets (`[id]`, `[slug]`) becomes available in the component:

```tsx
export default function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  return <div>ID: {params.id}</div>
}
```

---

## Prevention for Future

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Always use proper escaping** when creating dynamic routes:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "src/app/(authenticated)/services/[id]"
   ```

2. **Verify folder names** after creation:
   ```bash
   ls -la src/app/\(authenticated\)/services/
   ```

3. **Check Next.js error messages** carefully - they usually indicate routing conflicts

4. **Use IDE file creation** instead of terminal commands when possible
