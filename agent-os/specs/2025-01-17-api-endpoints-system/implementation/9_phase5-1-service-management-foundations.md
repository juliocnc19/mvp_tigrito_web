### Pagination:
- Page-based pagination
- Configurable page size (1-100 items)
- Total count tracking

- Transaction with all participants

## Statistics Tracking

### Transaction Statistics:

## Security Considerations

### Authentication:
- Service posting creation requires authentication
- Service offer creation requires Professional or Admin role
- Transaction management requires authentication

### Authorization:
- Clients can only create their own postings
- Professionals can only make offers on their own behalf
- Resource ownership validation

## Next Steps

### Remaining Service Endpoints:
- GET /services/postings/[id] - Get specific posting
- GET /services/offers/[id] - Get specific offer
- GET /services/offers/by-posting/[postingId] - Get posting offers
- POST /services/offers/[id]/accept - Accept offer
- POST /services/transactions/[id]/complete - Complete transaction
- GET /services/transactions - List transactions
- And more...

### Phase 5.2: Service Endpoints
