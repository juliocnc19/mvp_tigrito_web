## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| API delays | Medium | High | Use mock data in frontend |
| Performance issues | Low | High | Early optimization focus |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Medium | Test on multiple browsers |
| Accessibility compliance | Medium | Medium | Use accessibility tools from start |
| Dependency conflicts | Low | Medium | Pin versions in package.json |

### Contingency Plans

1. **If API falls behind**: Use mock data with stubs, integrate real API later
2. **If performance issues**: Implement lazy loading, code splitting earlier
3. **If accessibility issues**: Hire consultant, allocate extra time in Phase 4
4. **If unexpected bugs**: 10% buffer time reserved in schedule
