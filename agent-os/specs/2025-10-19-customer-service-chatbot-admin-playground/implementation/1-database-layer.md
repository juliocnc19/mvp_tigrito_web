# Implementation Report: Task Group 1 - Database Models and Migrations

**Implemented by:** database-engineer  
**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary
Successfully implemented the database layer for the Support Ticket system, including the new `SupportTicket` model, `TicketStatus` enum, and all necessary relationships with existing models.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created SupportTicket Model
**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added new `SupportTicket` model with the following structure:
- **id**: Primary key (cuid)
- **conversationId**: Unique foreign key to Conversation
- **clientId**: Foreign key to User (the client who initiated the ticket)
- **assignedToId**: Optional foreign key to User (the admin assigned to the ticket)
- **status**: TicketStatus enum (default: OPEN_AI_HANDLING)
- **escalationReason**: Optional text field for escalation details
- **initialSummary**: Optional text field for AI-generated summary
- **openedAt**: Timestamp (default: now())
- **assignedAt**: Optional timestamp for when ticket was assigned
- **closedAt**: Optional timestamp for when ticket was closed

### 2. Created TicketStatus Enum
**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added new enum with the following statuses:
- `OPEN_AI_HANDLING`: Initial state, chatbot is responding
- `PENDING_HUMAN_ASSIGNMENT`: Escalated, waiting for human agent
- `ACTIVE_HUMAN_CHAT`: Human agent is actively responding
- `CLOSED_RESOLVED`: Ticket resolved successfully
- `CLOSED_BY_CLIENT`: Client closed the ticket

### 3. Set Up Model Associations

#### User Model Updates
- Added `supportTicketsAsClient` relation (User has many tickets as client)
- Added `supportTicketsAsAgent` relation (User has many tickets as assigned agent)

#### Conversation Model Updates
- Added `supportTicket` relation (Conversation has one Support Ticket)

#### SupportTicket Model Relations
- `conversation`: Belongs to one Conversation
- `client`: Belongs to one User (as client)
- `assignedTo`: Optionally belongs to one User (as assigned agent)

### 4. Created Database Indexes
Added indexes for optimal query performance:
- `conversationId` (unique index)
- `clientId`
- `assignedToId`
- `status`
- `openedAt`

### 5. Created Migration
**File:** `prisma/migrations/20251019001416_add_support_ticket_model/migration.sql`

Migration includes:
- CREATE TYPE for TicketStatus enum
- CREATE TABLE for SupportTicket
- CREATE INDEX statements for all indexes
- ALTER TABLE statements for foreign key constraints

## Testing Approach

Since we're working with Prisma ORM which provides type safety and validation at compile time, and the database connection was not available during development, the following validation was performed:

1. ✅ **Schema Validation**: Prisma schema compiled successfully without errors
2. ✅ **Client Generation**: Prisma Client generated successfully, confirming all types and relationships are valid
3. ✅ **Migration SQL**: Migration file created with proper syntax and constraints

The Prisma ORM ensures:
- Type safety for all model operations
- Required field validation (conversationId, clientId, status, openedAt)
- Status enum validation (only valid TicketStatus values allowed)
- Foreign key constraints (referential integrity)
- Unique constraint on conversationId (one ticket per conversation)

## Files Created/Modified

### Modified Files
1. `prisma/schema.prisma`
   - Added SupportTicket model
   - Added TicketStatus enum
   - Updated User model with new relations
   - Updated Conversation model with supportTicket relation

### Created Files
2. `prisma/migrations/20251019001416_add_support_ticket_model/migration.sql`
   - Complete migration SQL for Support Ticket functionality

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ **SupportTicket model created** with all required fields and validations
- ✅ **Migration created** with proper indexes and foreign keys
- ✅ **Associations configured** correctly between SupportTicket, Conversation, and User
- ✅ **Schema validation passed** - Prisma format and generate completed successfully
- ✅ **Type safety ensured** - Prisma Client generated with proper types

## Notes

- The model follows existing Prisma patterns from Conversation and Message models
- All indexes are optimized for expected query patterns (filtering by status, client, assignment)
- The unique constraint on conversationId ensures data integrity (one ticket per conversation)
- Optional fields (assignedToId, assignedAt, closedAt, escalationReason, initialSummary) allow for flexible workflow states
- The TicketStatus enum provides clear ticket lifecycle management

## Next Steps

The database layer is now ready for:
1. API endpoint implementation (Task Group 2)
2. LangChain service integration
3. Ticket management business logic
