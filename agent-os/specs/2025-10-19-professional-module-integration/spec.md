# Specification: Professional Module Integration

## Goal
Complete the integration of the Professional Module frontend with backend APIs, replacing mock data with real-time data connections and implementing missing functionality for a fully functional professional management system.

## User Stories
- As a professional service provider, I want to manage my profile and services so that clients can find and hire me
- As a professional, I want to view and respond to service requests in real-time so that I don't miss opportunities
- As a professional, I want to track my earnings and job performance so that I can optimize my business
- As a professional, I want to upload portfolio images and certifications so that I can showcase my work quality
- As a professional, I want to receive notifications about new jobs and status updates so that I stay informed
- As a professional, I want to manage my work schedule and availability so that I can plan my time effectively

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Complete API integration using React Query for all professional operations
- Real-time job posting notifications and offer status updates
- Professional profile management with portfolio and certifications
- Service creation and management with pricing and location settings
- Job offer acceptance/rejection with automatic status updates
- Earnings tracking and performance analytics
- Secure file upload for images and documents
- Professional dashboard with key metrics and quick actions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- API response times under 500ms for critical operations
- Real-time updates with WebSocket connections
- Mobile-first responsive design with touch optimizations
- Secure file uploads with virus scanning and size limits
- Offline support for basic job management
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Visual Design
- Reference: Existing Professional Module UI components
- Key UI elements: Professional dashboard, service management forms, job cards, notification system
- Responsive breakpoints: Mobile (320px+), Tablet (768px+), Desktop (1024px+)
- Design system: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- Color scheme: Professional blue/purple theme with green accents for earnings

## Reusable Components

### Existing Code to Leverage
- Components: ProfessionalTopBar, ProfessionalNavigation, ProfessionalProfileHeader, TigresJobCard, ProfessionalServiceCard
- Services: Existing professional APIs (profile, services, postings, offers, transactions)
- Patterns: React Query hooks pattern from existing service hooks, modal patterns, card layouts

### New Components Required
- ProfessionalNotifications - Real-time notification system (no existing notification UI)
- FileUpload components - Secure file upload with drag-drop (extend existing patterns)
- ProfessionalAnalytics - Dashboard charts and metrics (no existing analytics UI)
- RealTimeIndicator - WebSocket connection status (new real-time feature)

## Technical Approach

### Database
- Extend existing User model with professional-specific fields
- ProfessionalProfile, Profession, ProfessionalService models already exist
- Add missing models: ProfessionalPortfolio, ProfessionalNotification
- Implement proper relationships and indexes for performance

### API
- Leverage existing endpoints: GET/POST/PUT professional APIs
- Implement missing endpoints: professions CRUD, portfolio management, notifications
- Add real-time WebSocket endpoints for live updates
- Implement file upload endpoints with cloud storage integration

### Frontend
- Implement React Query hooks for all professional operations
- Add WebSocket integration for real-time features
- Implement file upload components with progress indicators
- Create professional dashboard with charts and analytics
- Add notification system with sound and visual alerts

### Testing
- Unit tests for all React Query hooks
- Integration tests for API calls and error handling
- E2E tests for critical user flows (job acceptance, service creation)
- Performance tests for real-time features
- Accessibility tests for all new components

## Out of Scope
- Advanced AI matching algorithms for job recommendations
- Multi-language support beyond Spanish
- Advanced analytics beyond basic earnings and job tracking
- Video call integration for client consultations
- Payment processing integration (handled separately)
- Advanced scheduling with calendar integrations

## Success Criteria
- All professional CRUD operations working with real data
- Real-time notifications functioning without delays
- File uploads secure and working across all devices
- Mobile experience optimized with touch gestures
- API response times consistently under 500ms
- Test coverage above 85% for new functionality
- Zero critical bugs in production deployment
- Professional user satisfaction above 90% in testing
