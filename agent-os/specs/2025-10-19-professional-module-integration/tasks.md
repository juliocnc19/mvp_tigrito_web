## Execution Order

Recommended implementation sequence:
1. Database Layer (Task Group 1) - Foundation models
2. API Layer Basic (Task Group 2) - Core CRUD operations
3. API Layer Advanced (Task Group 3) - Real-time and file features
4. Frontend Integration (Task Group 4) - React Query hooks
5. UI Updates (Task Group 5) - Component enhancements
6. Integration Testing (Task Group 6) - End-to-end validation

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Performance**: Implement caching and optimize queries
- **Real-time Complexity**: Start with polling, upgrade to WebSocket
- **File Security**: Implement strict validation and scanning
- **Mobile Experience**: Test thoroughly on actual devices
- **Data Consistency**: Use transactions for critical operations
